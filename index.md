# Welcome to My Portfolio

Here you can find some of the projects I've worked on and more about my professional background.

        <h3>Prediction of COVID deaths and beds</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Used real-life google data and NHS data to identify key features that affected the number of COVID deaths and beds.
     Trained a regression model to predict hospital beds and COVID deaths using these features.</p>

        <h3>Visualising waveforms with CNNs</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Trained a CNN to identify whether a scintillator pulse was caused by an electron or a neutron.</p>

        <h3>Search for axions at LHCb</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Conducted novel analysis of signal simulation to account for bias in the LHCb detector. Trained a binary classifier to seperate B0 meson events from other backgrounds. The branching fraction of B0 decays to two photons was calculayed to search for signs of the axion. </p>
